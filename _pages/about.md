My name is Yuankang Liu. I am currently a third-year master student at ETH Zurich, where I study astrophysics and cosmology. 

My research is to study the galaxy formation using high performance computing facilities. I am currently develping a sub-grid turbulent dynamo model in the RAMSES code and studying the evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies anf circumgalactic medium (CGM). 

I was born in Xiangyang, China, where I received my primary and secondary education. At the age of 18, I went  to Shandong University majoring in physics. After two years there, I decided to continue my study at the University of Manchester in Britain. In 2018, I obtained my bachelor's degree from both universities. Then I moved to Zurich and began my study as a master student at ETH Zurich. In 2019, I joined the Institute for Computational Science at the University of Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Romain Teyssier and started my wonderful journey in computational astrophysics.
